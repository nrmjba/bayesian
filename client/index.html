						<h6 style="padding-top: 10px;">the bad news</h6>

						<p>
						You are a terrible guesser. 
						</p>

						<p>
						I'm also a terrible guesser. As are most people, with the exception of some well-trained meterologists and professional gamblers.
						</p>

						<p>
						When I say 'guessing,' I'm referring to a properly calibrated probability estimate. If one were to guess the gross domestic earnings of <em>The Goonies</em>, the answer would probably be wrong, because this tests specific domain knowledge. Rephrasing the question as:
						<blockquote>
						"What are your high and low estimates for the gross domestic earnings of the <em>The Goonies</em>? What interval estimate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence</a> would give this range?"
						</blockquote>

						The answer might be:
						<blockquote>
						"Between $100,000 to $100,000,000, inclusive, with 90% confidence."
						</blockquote>

						Given enough data points (say, the 100 top grossing films of 1980-1989) in a sufficiently ideal world, the estimated confidence interval would match the observed accuracy. In other words, the range estimates given with 90% confidence should &ndash; on average and with minimal variance &ndash; be correct 90% of the time. This changes the exercise from a measurement of trivia knowledge to a measurement of ability to gauge uncertainty.  However, only about 70% [ citation needed ] of estimated ranges with a 90% confidence interval will contain the actual value, not because of a lack of public knowledge in 20th century film economics, but because humans habitually display overconfident estimates. What we know is about 25-45 percent less than what we think we know [ citation needed ].
						</p>

						<p>
						The exact <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=goonies.htm">answer</a> is $61,389,680.

						<h6 style="padding-top: 10px;">cognitive bugs</h6>

						<p>
						There exists much more research investigating the limits and prejudgices of probability estimages than in their potential causes. The theories below are well-reasoned, but lack empirical evidence. (Note: while these theories are well thought-out and based on the attributed research, there is little to know empirical tests establishing causation to the 'uncalibration' of probability estimates).
						</p>
						<p>
						Cognitive biases that act against our correct estimation of prior probablity: 
						</p>
						<ul>
						<li>anchoring</li>
						<li>the pattern-seeking habits of human perception create the illusion of signal where there is only noisy data</li>
						<li>Prospect theory: small probabilities are overweighted, especially when attached to high-consequence events (p100, Scott Plous)</li>
						<li>we seek to reduce risk/uncertainty, and will pay an economic premium for it (p100, Plous)</li>
						<li>"missing, noisy or imprecise variables."  Ambguity makes us uncomfortable.</li>
						<li>Our educational training emphasizes algebra and calculus as the end goals, <a href="http://informaticsprofessor.blogspot.com/2013/05/basic-statistics-should-be-core.html">not probability and statistics</a></li>
						</ul>

						These biases are to estimation as geometrical-optical illusions [image] are to psychometrics. A simple change of the problem context causes a predicatable change in the perceived reality. In general, humans have a very troubled relationship with uncertainty. We don't understand it instintually, and a large part of current information science is devoted to ways of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n7/full/nmeth.2530.html">accurately communicating</a> it.

						<h6 style="padding-top: 10px;">you should care</h6>

						<p>
						Remember the last time you said you would be someplace, only there was traffic, you hit every red-light and got a flat tire?
						</p>
						<p>
						Or that time your project estimate was off by an order-of-magnitude?
						</p>
						<p>
						Or when that investment turned out so badly it scared you back into bonds and CD's for next ten years?
						</p>
						<p>
						Even if you don't live in a region with legalized gambling or work in a forecasting profession, your inability to estimate hurts you.
						</p>

						<h6 style="padding-top: 10px;">mensa mea bona est</h6>

						<p>
						Overconfident guessing follows a predictable pattern. Overconfidence is usual for difficult assessments (although slightly less for T/F tests; Hubbard p64). Underconfidence for easy ones. Calibration fixes this.
						<ul>
						<li>Rationalize answers with pros and cons (Hubbard p64)</li>
						<li>Range estimates to reduce the anchoring effect of a point estimate. Particularly, working towards a narrow range for an absurdly large range.</li>
						<li>Confidence intervals</li>
						<li></li>
						</ul>
						</p>

						<h6 style="padding-top: 10px;">the n-step method</h6>
						<p>
						<ul>
						<li>Get comfortable with uncertainty, particularly the idea of giving uncertain unaswers</li>
						<li>Practice gauging your uncertainty</li>
						<li>Think probablistically!</li>
						<li></li>
						</ul>
